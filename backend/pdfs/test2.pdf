EIDOLONS
 I met a seer,
Passing the hues and objects of the world, The fields of art and learning, pleasure,
sense, To glean eidolons.
 Put in thy chants said he,
No more the puzzling hour nor day, nor segments, parts, put in, Put first before the rest as light for all
and entrance-song of all, That of eidolons.
 Ever the dim beginning,
Ever the growth, the rounding of the circle,
Ever the summit and the merge at last, (to surely start again,) Eidolons! eidolons!
 Ever the mutable,
Ever materials, changing, crumbling, re-cohering, Ever the ateliers, the factories divine,
Issuing eidolons.
 Lo, I or you,
Or woman, man, or state, known or unknown, We seeming solid wealth, strength, beauty
build, But really build eidolons.
 The ostent evanescent,
The substance of an artist’s mood or savan’s studies long, Or warrior’s, martyr’s, hero’s toils,
To fashion his eidolon.
 Of every human life,
(The units gather’d, posted, not a thought, emotion, deed, left out,)
The whole or large or small summ’d, added up, In its eidolon.
 The old, old urge,
Based on the ancient pinnacles, lo, newer, higher pinnacles,
From science and the modern still impell’d, The old, old urge, eidolons.
 The present now and here,
America’s busy, teeming, intricate whirl,
Of aggregate and segregate for only thence releasing, To-day’s eidolons.
 These with the past,
Of vanish’d lands, of all the reigns of kings across the sea, Old conquerors, old campaigns,
old sailors’ voyages, Joining eidolons.
 Densities, growth, facades,
Strata of mountains, soils, rocks, giant trees, Far-born, far-dying, living long, to
leave, Eidolons everlasting.
 Exalte, rapt, ecstatic,
The visible but their womb of birth,
Of orbic tendencies to shape and shape and shape, The mighty earth-eidolon.
 All space, all time,
(The stars, the terrible perturbations of the suns,
Swelling, collapsing, ending, serving their longer, shorter use,) Fill’d with eidolons only.
